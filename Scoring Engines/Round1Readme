Welcome to the WSHCP Round One competition image!

To start the scoring engine, navigate to the "scripts" folder on your 
Desktop in the terminal. 
$ cd ~/Desktop/scripts
Once you are in directory, run:
$ git pull
Then, run the script with the following command:
$ sudo ./r1scoringengine.sh

It will calculate your current score. Once you do something in the image, you can rerun the r1scoringengine script and it will update your score. Keep rerunning the script. 

We ask that you do not read the scoringengine script, it contains all the answers. If you read all of the answers, you are invalidating this training. 

Have fun!

You and your friend Daniel have been developing a cool new phone app for a website called 8ch.org. 
You want your friend Daniel to be secure and keep al of his development info safe. 
Daniel has a development team that needs to be able to access this machine remotely. 
Daniel needs an account on the computer, he wants it to be called "abracadaniel".

Daniel hates fun, and his policies dictate that there are no games or mediafiles allowed on this pc computer. (Note: You don't need to remove the wallpaper)

We all know that Daniel is an elite hacker, but Daniel doesn't want any of his dev team to know about his 'leet hacks and hack him back.
So the use of any malware or password cracking tools is stricly prohibited. 

This computer is to be used only as a development station / remote development station. The only critical server service on this pc is sshd.
